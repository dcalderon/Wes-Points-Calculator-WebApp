Simple Wesleyan Points Calculator README
========================================

About
-----
A good friend lisa sy had some base code to calculate
the number of points people could Wesleyan University
currency for what remained of the semester. I borrowed
said code, cleaned it up a tad and added a little graphic.
There is still much we want to do to improve this tool.
I wrote this in javascript, using several little packages.

Installation
------------
For this to work properly you need to link to jquery,
flot, and the flot pie library. All of these are not that
difficult to come by.

Documentation
-------------
I feel that my javascript is basic enough to understand alone.
In addition I tried to document any points of confusion.

Files
.....
Even though it is terrible design, I threw everything together
in one html file. What can I say, it's a tiny little app. In
future iterations I'll organize things.

ReStructured Text
.................
WSIFT documentation, like this ``README``, is written in
reStructuredText. To generate HTML-formatted design documentation using
reStructuredText, install docutils (available at
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/) and run commands analogous to
the following:

    | ``$ cd doc/``
    | ``$ rst2html example.rst example.html``

To view the documentation, open ``design.html`` using your favorite web
browser. If you'd rather view the plaintext documentation, open
``design.rst``.
